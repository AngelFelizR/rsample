\title{V-Fold Cross-Validation}
\usage{
vfold_cv(data, v = 10, repeats = 1, strata = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{v}{The number of partitions of the data set.}

\item{repeats}{The number of times to repeat the V-fold partitioning.}

\item{strata}{A variable that is used to conduct stratified sampling to create the folds. (not working yet)}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}
}
\value{
An tibble with classes \code{vfold_cv}, \code{rset}, \code{tbl_df}, \code{tbl}, and \code{data.frame}. The results include a column for the data split objects and one or more identification variables. For a single repeats, there will be one column called \code{id} that has a character string with the fold identifier. For repeats, \code{id} is the repeat number and an additional column called \code{id2} that contains the fold information (within repeat).
}
\description{
V-fold cross-validation randomly splits the data into V groups of roughly equal size (called "folds"). A resample of the analysis data consisted of V-1 of the folds while the assessment set contains the final fold. In basic V-fold cross-validation (i.e. no repeats), the number of resamples is equal to V.
}
\details{
The \code{strata} argument causes the random sampling to be conducted \emph{within the stratification variable}. The can help ensure that the number of data points in the analysis data is equivalent to the proportions in the original data set.  

When more than one repeat is requested, the basic V-fold cross-validation is conducted each time. For example, if three repeats are used with \code{v = 10}, there are a total of 30 splits which as three groups of 10 that are generated separately.

vfold_cv(mtcars, V = 10)
